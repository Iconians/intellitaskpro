# IntelliTaskPro – AI-Powered Project Management SaaS

A production-ready **multi-tenant project management platform** built with **Next.js, TypeScript, and Neon PostgreSQL**.

The system supports **organization-based tenancy, role-based access control, Stripe subscription billing, AI-powered task generation, and real-time collaboration**.

Designed using modern SaaS architecture patterns including **background workers, usage-based plan enforcement, and scalable API design**.

## Live Application

Production site: https://intellitaskpro.com

IntelliTaskPro is a fully deployed SaaS platform where organizations can manage projects, collaborate in real time, and use AI-assisted planning tools.

Users can create organizations, invite team members, manage boards, and subscribe to paid plans through Stripe.

## Production Features

IntelliTaskPro includes several capabilities typically required for real SaaS applications:

• Multi-tenant organization architecture  
• Stripe subscription billing and customer portal integration  
• Usage-based plan enforcement  
• Role-based access control across organizations and boards  
• Background job processing with Redis and BullMQ  
• Real-time collaboration using Pusher  
• AI-assisted task planning and sprint generation

## Tech Stack

Frontend
- Next.js (App Router)
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

Backend
- Node.js
- Prisma ORM

## Database Architecture

The system uses a **multi-tenant relational schema** designed for organization isolation.

Core entities:

User → authentication and user accounts  
Organizations → top-level tenant isolation  
Teams → organizational groups  
Members → user-role relationships within organizations  

Project management:

Boards → project boards  
Tasks → individual work items  
Sprints → time-boxed planning cycles  
Comments → task discussion threads  

SaaS infrastructure:

Subscription → organization billing  
Plan → plan limits and features  
Usage → usage tracking and enforcement

## Authentication & Authorization

The system uses NextAuth.js with Credentials provider:

- Protected routes via middleware
- **Organization-level roles**: ADMIN, MEMBER, VIEWER (control organization-wide access)
- **Board-level roles**: ADMIN, MEMBER, VIEWER (granular per-board access control)
- Explicit board access required - users must be granted access to each board
- Organization admins can manage board membership, board admins can manage board content

## Real-time Updates

Real-time features use Pusher:
- Task updates broadcast to all connected clients
- Board changes sync in real-time
- Connection state management

Alternative: Use polling by setting `refetchInterval` in React Query.

## Background Workers

The worker service handles:
- **Reminders**: Scheduled task reminders via email
- **Automation**: Rule-based task automation
- **Cron Jobs**: Daily reports, sprint status updates, cleanup tasks

## Development

- Run Prisma Studio: `bun run db:studio`
- Generate Prisma client: `bun run db:generate`
- Run migrations: `bun run db:migrate`

## Stripe Setup

1. **Create Products and Prices**:
   - Go to Stripe Dashboard → Products
   - Create "Pro" product with monthly price ($29.99)
   - Create "Enterprise" product with monthly price ($99.99)
   - Copy the Price IDs (start with `price_`)

2. **Update Database**:
   ```bash
   STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID=price_xxx STRIPE_ENTERPRISE_PRICE_ID=price_yyy bun run update-stripe-prices
   ```

3. **Set Up Webhooks**:
   - Go to Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks

     - `customer.subscription.updated`
     - `customer.subscription.deleted`
     - `checkout.session.completed`
     - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
     - `invoice.payment_failed`
   - Copy the webhook signing secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

4. **For Local Development**:
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
   ```
   Copy the webhook signing secret from the output to your `.env.local`

## Subscription Plans

The system includes three default plans:

- **Free**: $0/month
  - 3 boards, 5 members, 50 tasks

4. Run database migrations: `bun run db:push`
5. Seed default plans: `bun run db:seed`
6. Update Stripe price IDs: `bun run update-stripe-prices`
7. (Optional) Deploy worker service separately (e.g., Railway, Render)

## Migration from Supabase

This project was migrated from Supabase to Neon. Key changes:
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL → Neon PostgreSQL
- Auth: Supabase Auth → NextAuth.js
- Realtime: Supabase Realtime → Pusher
- Storage: Removed (not implemented)

## AI Configuration (Free Options for Portfolio)

The system supports multiple AI providers, with **free options perfect for portfolio projects**:

### 1. Google Gemini (Default - Free Tier) ⭐ Recommended
- **Cost**: Free (15 requests/minute), then $0.075 per 1M tokens
- **Setup**: Get free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
- **Best for**: Real AI with generous free tier - perfect for portfolio projects
- **Usage**: Set `AI_PROVIDER=gemini` (default) and `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key`
- **Note**: Uses `gemini-1.5-flash` model for fast, cost-effective responses

### 2. Demo Mode (Fallback - Completely Free)
- **Cost**: $0
- **Setup**: No API keys needed
- **How it works**: Rule-based task generation that simulates AI
- **Best for**: Portfolio demos when API keys aren't available
- **Usage**: Set `AI_PROVIDER=demo` (automatic fallback if Gemini fails)

### 3. Ollama (Local - Completely Free)
- **Cost**: $0 (runs on your machine)
- **Setup**: 
  ```bash
  # Install Ollama
  curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
  
  # Pull a model (e.g., Llama 3)
  ollama pull llama3
  ```
- **Best for**: Full control, no API limits, completely free
- **Usage**: Set `AI_PROVIDER=ollama` and optionally `OLLAMA_URL` and `OLLAMA_MODEL`

### 4. Paid Options (Optional)
- **OpenAI**: GPT-3.5 Turbo (~$2 per 1000 generations)
- **Anthropic**: Claude Haiku (~$1.50 per 1000 generations)

### Recommendation for Portfolio
Use **Google Gemini** - it's free (15 requests/minute), provides real AI capabilities, and demonstrates the feature perfectly. Just get a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) and set `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` in your `.env.local`.

The system automatically falls back to demo mode if Gemini is unavailable, so it always works!
